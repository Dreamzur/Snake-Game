# Snake Game
This is a simple snake game made on intellij but pushed through replit, therefore, the code inside this project will be optimized for replit use only.

Enjoy the :snake:!

# Work in progress
Still adding features to the game. :smile:
Currently looking to add:
- [✅] Image for snake head & body
- [✅] Restart game option
- [✅] Game ending apples (bad apples)
- [ ] Gradual speed increase after eating apple
- [ ] More bad apples on screen

# Features needing to be fixed :wrench:
- [ ] Still hunting for bugs :bug:

# Scrapped Features 🚮
Due to replit not reading the audio file, these features will be scrapped now now:
- [❌] Sound
